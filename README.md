## Overview
This project is currently being developed to use features extracted from SpArcFiRe outputs to predict Hubble T-type classifications of galaxies with open-source machine learning algorithms.

## Data
This project currently uses the EFIGI dataset, which can be found at https://www.astromatic.net/projects/efigi/, and SpArcFiRe outputs on SDSS galaxies. The data is not included in this github repository, but can be found through UCI OpenLab at this path: /extra/wayne2/preserve/mkfang/sparcfire-morphology/data
